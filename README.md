## Source installation
1) Go to into your Unity3D installation folder (in my case its c:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed).

2) Locate two dll files: UnityEngine.dll and UnityEditor.dll.

3) Copy them into packages\Unity folder.

This files are not placed into this repository because of difference between my unity version and yours.

## Unity3D-Path-Finder
Unity 3D path found project, assets will look up a valid path through 2d maze. For this moment project includes **Wave** and **Jump Point** search algorithms.
