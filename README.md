Maze navigation algorithms for Unity. My first attempt to make a shared library with Unity assets. This assets will look up a valid path through 2d maze.
Code was witten to work with Unity 4.x and currently no supported since Unity has it's own build-in implementation. Please use it only for self-education activities.
For this moment project consists of **Wave** and **Jump Point** search algorithms.
